## 2026-07-04 - Storefront Variant Cart and CI Stabilization

Reason:

- Latest storefront merchandising work added variable product/cart behavior and exposed a CI-only failure where Storefront Settings domain sync tests failed under `php artisan test --env=testing`.

Changed files:

- `app/Filament/Resources/Orders/Schemas/OrderForm.php`
- `app/Filament/Resources/StorefrontSettings/Pages/CreateStorefrontSetting.php`
- `app/Filament/Resources/StorefrontSettings/Pages/EditStorefrontSetting.php`
- `app/Http/Controllers/Storefront/CartController.php`
- `app/Http/Controllers/Storefront/CheckoutController.php`
- `app/Models/StockMovement.php`
- `app/Services/OrderWorkflowService.php`
- `app/Services/StockMovementService.php`
- `app/Services/StorefrontCart.php`
- `database/migrations/2026_07_03_050000_add_product_variant_id_to_stock_movements.php`
- `database/seeders/DemoDataSeeder.php`
- `resources/views/storefront/cart/show.blade.php`
- `resources/views/storefront/checkout/show.blade.php`
- `resources/views/storefront/checkout/success.blade.php`
- `resources/views/storefront/products/show.blade.php`
- `tests/Feature/PhaseFourAdminPagesTest.php`
- `tests/Feature/ProductVariantTest.php`
- `PROJECT_GUIDE.md`

What changed:

- Storefront carts now keep product variants as separate lines using product + variant keys.
- Variable product pages can submit multiple variant quantities in one add-to-cart request.
- Checkout stores `product_variant_id`, `variant_label`, variant price, and variant cost on order items.
- Sale stock movements can reference a variant and update/restore variant stock with signed movement deltas.
- Variable products keep parent stock synced from active variant stock without the product stock ledger overwriting it.
- Demo data now includes richer storefront sample products, variant products, pages, and courier provider records.
- Storefront Settings domain sync tests now set Livewire `data.*` state directly and the create/edit pages merge raw form state before syncing company domain fields, stabilizing `php artisan test --env=testing`.

Verification:

- `php artisan test --env=testing --filter=PhaseFourAdminPagesTest` passed.
- `php artisan test --filter=PhaseFourAdminPagesTest` passed.
- `php artisan test --env=testing` passed: 176 tests, 787 assertions.

Commit status: Pending commit and push requested by user.

## 2026-07-03 - Storefront "Top-Class Reference Pattern" (Part 4.6 remaining items)

Reason:

- Master plan Part 4.6 listed 7 accepted UI patterns from the SkyBuy/MoveOn reference analysis (mega menu, dual banner, header chat+call button, curated carousel, "how to order" explainer, sister-company cross-promotion, mobile bottom nav) as not yet implemented. This pass implements everything except the curated carousel, which needs a new Filament resource and was intentionally left out of scope for this change.

Changed files:

- `database/migrations/2026_07_03_010000_add_dual_banner_and_phone_to_storefront_settings_table.php` (new)
- `app/Models/StorefrontSetting.php`
- `app/Filament/Resources/StorefrontSettings/StorefrontSettingResource.php`
- `resources/views/storefront/layout.blade.php`
- `resources/views/storefront/home.blade.php`
- `business_dashboard_master_plan_v2_custom_storefront.md`
- `PROJECT_GUIDE.md`

What changed:

- Added `storefront_settings.banner_image_mobile` (nullable) and `storefront_settings.phone_number` (nullable) columns.
- Header mega menu: hover dropdown under "Categories" listing the company's active categories that have available products.
- Header call button: `tel:` link next to WhatsApp, shown only when `phone_number` is set.
- Dual banner: `home.blade.php` hero uses `<picture>`/`<source media="(max-width: 639px)">` to show `banner_image_mobile` on phones and the existing desktop banner otherwise.
- "How to order" explainer: static 4-step icon+text section on the homepage between the hero and category grid.
- Sister-company cross-promotion: footer section linking to other active companies with a published storefront and a domain.
- Mobile bottom nav: fixed `sm:hidden` bar (Home/Category/Cart with badge/Account); `<main>` and `<footer>` get bottom spacing so content isn't hidden under it.
- `StorefrontSettingResource` form: new "Call support number" field and a second, separate "Banner image (mobile)" upload alongside the existing desktop banner upload field.

Verification:

- `php artisan migrate --force`
- `npm run build`
- `php artisan test --filter=StorefrontFoundationTest` (20/20)
- `php artisan test --filter=PhaseFourAdminPagesTest` (3/3)
- Full suite `php artisan test` (169/169 passed, 767 assertions)
- Manual verification via local preview: mega menu dropdown, mobile bottom nav rendering (confirmed via computed `display: grid` at 375px width since the screenshot tool was unavailable this session), category/product data on the homepage.

Commit status: Not committed. Commit and push require explicit user approval.

## 2026-07-03 - Storefront Visual Redesign and Admin Homepage Content Settings

Reason:

- The storefront was functionally complete but visually read as a template rather than a considered Shopify-quality ecommerce site: no real light/dark toggle (dark: classes only followed OS preference), heavy `font-black`/`rounded-full`-everywhere styling with little hierarchy, no quick-add hover interaction or quantity stepper, no sort/filter on the product listing, no related products, and hero copy hardcoded in the blade file instead of admin-editable.

Changed files:

- `resources/css/app.css`
- `resources/views/storefront/layout.blade.php`
- `resources/views/storefront/home.blade.php`
- `resources/views/storefront/partials/product-card.blade.php`
- `resources/views/storefront/products/index.blade.php`
- `resources/views/storefront/products/show.blade.php`
- `resources/views/storefront/cart/show.blade.php`
- `resources/views/storefront/checkout/show.blade.php`
- `resources/views/storefront/checkout/success.blade.php`
- `resources/views/storefront/account/orders.blade.php`
- `resources/views/storefront/track/show.blade.php`
- `resources/views/storefront/pages/show.blade.php`
- `app/Http/Controllers/Storefront/ProductIndexController.php`
- `app/Http/Controllers/Storefront/ProductShowController.php`
- `app/Http/Controllers/Storefront/PreviewController.php`
- `app/Models/StorefrontSetting.php`
- `app/Filament/Resources/StorefrontSettings/StorefrontSettingResource.php`
- `database/migrations/2026_07_03_000000_add_hero_and_theme_fields_to_storefront_settings_table.php`
- `PROJECT_GUIDE.md`
- `UPDATE_NOTES.md`

What changed:

- Added a real class-based dark mode toggle: `@custom-variant dark` in `app.css`, an inline pre-paint script plus a header sun/moon button in `layout.blade.php` that toggles `<html>.dark` and persists the choice to `localStorage`, defaulting to a new `storefront_settings.theme_mode` (`system`/`light`/`dark`) on first visit. Implemented in vanilla JS since no Alpine.js is loaded in the storefront Vite bundle.
- Replaced the `font-black` + `rounded-full`-everywhere visual language across all storefront views with a restrained hierarchy (semibold/medium weights, `rounded-lg`/`rounded-xl` components, thinner gray borders) closer to an actual Shopify storefront.
- Added a quick-add hover button on product cards, a vanilla-JS quantity stepper (`+`/`-`) on the product detail and cart pages, a sticky buy box on product detail, and a sticky order summary on cart/checkout.
- Added product listing sort (`?sort=price_asc|price_desc`, default newest) and category quick-filter chips.
- Added a "You may also like" related-products rail on product detail (same category, excludes current product, limit 4).
- Added admin-editable homepage hero fields (`hero_heading`, `hero_subheading`, `hero_cta_label`) and a `theme_mode` default select to the Storefront Settings form, under a new "Homepage Content" section; blank values fall back to the previous hardcoded copy.

Verification:

- `php artisan migrate --force` applied the new `storefront_settings` columns.
- `npm run build` passed.
- `php artisan test --filter=StorefrontFoundationTest` passed (20 tests).
- `php artisan test --filter=PhaseFourAdminPagesTest` passed (3 tests).
- Manually verified via a local `php artisan serve` preview: home, product listing (with sort/filter chips), product detail (stepper + related products), cart, and checkout in both light and dark mode, and at mobile (375px) and desktop (1440px) widths.

- Not committed. Commit and push require explicit user approval.

## 2026-07-03 - Storefront Settings Form Synchronization

Reason:

- Storefront Settings list showed domain and readiness fields, but the edit page did not expose every underlying setting, creating a synchronization gap for admins.
- A duplicate domain such as `zamzamgadgetbd.com` could still hit the database unique constraint when assigned to the wrong company from the Storefront Settings form.

Changed files:

- `app/Filament/Resources/StorefrontSettings/StorefrontSettingResource.php`
- `app/Filament/Resources/StorefrontSettings/Pages/CreateStorefrontSetting.php`
- `app/Filament/Resources/StorefrontSettings/Pages/EditStorefrontSetting.php`
- `tests/Feature/PhaseFourAdminPagesTest.php`
- `PROJECT_GUIDE.md`
- `UPDATE_NOTES.md`

What changed:

- Added a Filament default `Domain and Launch Readiness` section to the Storefront Settings form.
- Exposed `Storefront Domain` and `Domain verified` in Storefront Settings create/edit forms.
- Added read-only readiness, missing setup, visible products, and published pages summaries in the edit form.
- Synchronized `company_domain` and `company_domain_verified` form fields back to `companies.domain` and `companies.domain_verified` on create/save.
- Added tests that verify the edit form shows the same readiness-related options as the list and that saving Storefront Settings updates the company domain fields.
- Added duplicate-domain validation before saving company domain fields so admins get a form error instead of a 500.

Verification:

- `php artisan test --filter=PhaseFourAdminPagesTest` passed.
- `php artisan test --filter=StorefrontFoundationTest` passed.

Commit status:

- Not committed. Commit and push require explicit user approval.

## 2026-07-03 - Storefront Admin Launch Dashboard

Reason:

- The storefront site polish existed on the public side, but admins still needed a Filament-default dashboard surface to see whether each storefront is ready to launch.

Changed files:

- `app/Filament/Resources/StorefrontSettings/StorefrontSettingResource.php`
- `tests/Feature/PhaseFourAdminPagesTest.php`
- `PROJECT_GUIDE.md`
- `UPDATE_NOTES.md`

What changed:

- Added launch-readiness columns to Storefront Settings using Filament default table UI.
- Added missing setup visibility for publish/domain/logo/banner/SEO/WhatsApp/pages/products.
- Added visible product count and published page count per storefront.
- Added domain verified visibility.
- Added default Filament record actions for Preview, Open Site, and Pages.
- Updated admin page test coverage for the new storefront dashboard surface.
- Updated `PROJECT_GUIDE.md` with the admin launch dashboard behavior and verification command.

Verification:

- `php artisan test --filter=PhaseFourAdminPagesTest` passed.
- `php artisan test --filter=StorefrontFoundationTest` passed.

Commit status:

- Not committed. Commit and push require explicit user approval.

## 2026-07-02 - Storefront Part 4 Site Polish

Reason:

- WooCommerce migration is intentionally deferred until after the storefront site work is complete.
- Part 4 still needed customer-facing polish, launch readiness cleanup, and storefront verification without changing admin/dashboard UI.

Changed files:

- `resources/views/storefront/layout.blade.php`
- `resources/views/storefront/home.blade.php`
- `resources/views/storefront/partials/product-card.blade.php`
- `resources/views/storefront/products/show.blade.php`
- `resources/views/storefront/cart/show.blade.php`
- `resources/views/storefront/checkout/success.blade.php`
- `tests/Feature/StorefrontFoundationTest.php`
- `PROJECT_GUIDE.md`
- `UPDATE_NOTES.md`

What changed:

- Added SEO/Open Graph/Twitter metadata support from storefront settings.
- Added banner-image hero support and removed decorative gradient/orb styling from the storefront hero.
- Made the storefront header more mobile-safe by truncating long company names and hiding lower-priority actions on small screens.
- Added footer WhatsApp contact visibility for mobile users.
- Replaced internal/roadmap wording in cart and homepage copy with customer-facing storefront copy.
- Added clearer out-of-stock labels and disabled button text on product cards and product detail pages.
- Improved checkout success action wrapping for mobile screens.
- Added storefront test assertions for the public announcement and Open Graph metadata.
- Updated `PROJECT_GUIDE.md` with the polished storefront behavior and local smoke-check routes.

Verification:

- `php artisan test --filter=StorefrontFoundationTest` passed.
- `npm run build` passed.
- Local HTTP smoke checks returned `200` for `/storefront`, `/storefront/main-company/products`, `/storefront/main-company/cart`, `/storefront/main-company/track`, and `/storefront/main-company/account/orders`.
- Browser connector was unavailable due an environment metadata error, so screenshot-based visual QA could not be completed in this run.

Commit status:

- Not committed. Commit and push require explicit user approval.

## 2026-06-29 - Agent Rule: Filament Default Dashboard UI

Reason:

- Dashboard/admin UI should stay consistent and maintainable by using Filament's default UI system.

Changed files:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `UPDATE_NOTES.md`

What changed:

- Added a project rule that dashboard/admin UI must use Filament default components and patterns only.
- Clarified that even custom dashboard modules or elements should be built with Filament default UI rather than custom-styled dashboard components.

Verification:

- Documentation-only change; no tests required.

Commit status:

- Not committed. Commit and push require explicit user approval.

## 2026-06-29 - Courier Pending Live Adapter Guardrail

Reason:

- Part 4 storefront verification was complete, so the next safe Part 7 courier step was to prepare Pathao, RedX, and E-Courier adapter boundaries without pretending live API integrations are ready.
- Official merchant API credentials, request field mappings, and sandbox/live response samples are still required before enabling live Pathao, RedX, or E-Courier booking/sync/webhook flows.

Changed files:

- `app/Services/CourierManager.php`
- `app/Services/Couriers/PendingLiveCourierAdapter.php`
- `app/Services/Couriers/PathaoCourierAdapter.php`
- `app/Services/Couriers/RedxCourierAdapter.php`
- `app/Services/Couriers/ECourierAdapter.php`
- `tests/Feature/CourierIntegrationTest.php`
- `PROJECT_GUIDE.md`

What changed:

- Added explicit pending live adapters for Pathao, RedX, and E-Courier.
- Wired those adapters into `CourierManager`.
- Pending providers now fail live booking/sync/balance/webhook operations with a clear setup message instead of an ambiguous missing-adapter error.
- Added a feature test that confirms pending live providers resolve but reject booking until official API details are supplied.
- Updated `PROJECT_GUIDE.md` with the new courier adapter status and verification note.

Verification:

- `php artisan demo:refresh` passed.
- `php artisan test --filter=StorefrontFoundationTest` passed.
- `npm run build` passed.
- `php artisan test --filter=CourierIntegrationTest` passed.
- `php artisan test` passed: 167 tests, 737 assertions.

Commit status:

- Not committed. Commit and push require explicit user approval.
